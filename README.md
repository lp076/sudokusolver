# sudokusolver
A short script that solves sudoku boards

HOW TO USE:
As there is no GUI at the moment, you need to manually input a board
the program comes with an example board already built-in to the code, but you're welcome to change it if you'd like

to change the board, open the file in a text editor and find the "board" variable on line 1.
each set of bracket in the "board" variable is a row in a normal sudoku board.
simply replace any previously filled numbers with your board, and make sure the empty cells in the board are set to 0.

from there, you should be able to run the script as a normal python3 file and it will solve and output a solution.

You are more than welcome to make any changes to the script as you see fit ir just to see what things do.
